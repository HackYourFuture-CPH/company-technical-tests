# The challenge

A fictitious client called Yoyo Cinema have tasked Nodes to build a web app where their customers are able to search for films, see details, favourite, etc.

1. Get an apikey from https://www.themoviedb.org/
2. Film search (using this API endpoint https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=&query=<search_query> (GET)), display the films in whatever UI you want.
3. The user should be able to see details of the film (endpoint https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/?api_key= (GET)).
4. The user should be able to favourite and unfavorite a movie (use whatever local storage that you think make sense).
5. The user should be able to see a list of favourite movies (and from there go to the detail movie screen).
6. You can use either ReactJS, VueJS, or AngularJS, any UI, make as many or little comments you like, just remember that we will be looking through the code and want to get a good understanding of your skills.

The code should be zipped and sent back. We should, as minimum, be able to run the wep app in the browser.
