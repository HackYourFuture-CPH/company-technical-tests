### Requirements
The application must be optimized for mobile and run in the latest version of Safari and Chrome.

### User stories
* As a user, I experience that the application asks for permission to use my location.
* As a user, I get the current temperature and cloudiness (icon) at my current position.
* As a user, I experience that the application gives me a funny message depending on the temperature (view table 1.0).
* As a user, I experience that the application has different colour themes and icons for day and night.

Table 1.0

| Temperature | Message |
| ----------- | ------- |
| < 0 oC | Stay inside. It really really isn’t worth it today! |
| 0 - 10 oC | Put on a lot of layers and you might be okay... Might! |
| 10 - 20 oC | Shouldn’t you be outside and do stuff right now? |
| + 20 oC | It’s gettin’ hot in here... Burn burn burn... and so on |
