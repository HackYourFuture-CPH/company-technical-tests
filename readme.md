# Technical tests

When companies try to asses new students, the companies normally give them some kind of test. We have here gathered some of those tests. It can be super good practice to try and go through these tests and see what is expected.

Tests:
* **Seatgeek:** https://github.com/awbergs/seatgeek-frontend

* **Subit:**
  * [Frontend](subit/subit%20-%20candidate%20test%20frontend.pdf)

  * [Backend](subit/subit%20-%20candidate%20test%20backend.pdf)
